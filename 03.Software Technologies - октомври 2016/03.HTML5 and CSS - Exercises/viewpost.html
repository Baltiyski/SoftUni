                        <h2>Can Stanford’s Deep Dive Into Virtual Reality Help Save the Oceans?</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>
                        Stanford professor Jeremy Bailenson and fellow researchers at the school’s Virtual Human Interaction Lab (VHIL) have been exploring the effects of virtual reality on human behavior since the late 1990s.
                        They’ve written countless papers documenting the fact that experiences in a virtual world—like exercising more, saving for retirement, using less paper, or showing more empathy—change behavior in the real one.
                        They initially used expensive, custom-built hardware for their research; the kind of VR systems available today, like the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive, didn’t exist when they conducted most of their experiments.
                        But now that VR systems have gotten out of the lab and into the world, the team is beginning to let some of its work loose as well.
                        This week, for the first time, the researchers publicly released one of their potentially behavior-changing VR simulations for free download for the HTC Vive.
                        The Ocean Acidification Experience is intended to teach users about the chemistry behind ocean acidification, as well as the problems it causes, and what they can do to help prevent it.
                        To hit those marks, of course, the simulation has to be engaging enough to keep users involved.

                        <h2>New Computer Combines Electronic Circuits with Light Pulses</h2>

                        Modern computers still lack the capability to find the best solution for the classic “traveling salesman” problem.
                        Even finding approximate solutions is challenging.
                        But finding the shortest traveling salesman route among many different cities is more than just an academic exercise.
                        This class of problems lies at the heart of many real-world business challenges such as scheduling delivery truck routes or discovering new pharmaceutical drugs.

                        Today’s computers handle combinatorial optimization problems by skipping some of the weaker solutions instead of considering all possibilities to find the very best solution.
                        But U.S. and Japanese researchers have unveiled a new specialized computer that could someday solve the traveling salesman scenario and similar problems more efficiently.
                        Their hybrid machine combines digital electronic circuits with optical devices similar to lasers.
